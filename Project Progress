2. Challenges 

Technical Challenges: 

Challenge 1: Integration Issues 

Description: Integrating the front-end with the back-end APIs has proven to be more complex than anticipated, particularly with managing state and ensuring consistent data flow. 

Adaptation: We are revising our API endpoints to better match the needs of the front-end and are implementing more rigorous testing to catch issues early. 

Challenge 2: Database Schema Design 

Description: Designing a robust database schema that supports our application’s requirements has required more iterations than expected. 

Adaptation: We have adjusted our schema to include additional tables and relationships to better manage user and resource data. 

Non-Technical Challenges: 

Challenge 1: Coordination of Team Schedules 

Description: Aligning team members' schedules for meetings and collaborative work sessions has been challenging due to varying availability. 

Adaptation: We’ve implemented more structured check-ins and adjusted our work hours to overlap more effectively.

3. Collaboration/Communication 

Team Collaboration: 

Successes: 

Clear Task Allocation: Each team member has clearly defined responsibilities, which has helped streamline our workflow. 

Regular Check-ins: Daily stand-up meetings have improved communication and allowed us to quickly address issues as they arise. 

Challenges: 

Collaboration Tools: Initially, using multiple tools for communication (Slack, Google Docs, etc.) caused some confusion. 

Adaptation: We have consolidated our communication to a single platform and established clearer guidelines for updates and task tracking. 

Collaboration with Peers/Mentors: 

Peer Feedback: We’ve received useful feedback from other teams during the PLD check-ins, which has highlighted areas for improvement in our implementation. 

Mentor Guidance: Our mentor provided valuable insights into optimizing our API design and handling error management, which we have incorporated into our plan.

4. Project Updates 

Changes to Deliverables: 

Change 1: Revised API Endpoints 

Reasoning: Based on initial integration testing, we found that some API endpoints needed to be adjusted to better fit the front-end requirements. 

Change 2: Enhanced Error Handling 

Reasoning: Added more comprehensive error handling to improve the user experience and make debugging easier.

5. Progress 

Progress Rating: 6/10 

Measurement: 

Tasks Completed: We have successfully set up the basic infrastructure for both the front-end and back-end and made significant progress on core functionalities such as user authentication and resource management. 

Pending Tasks: Integration, extensive testing, and finalizing UI/UX components are ongoing. 

Assessment: 

On Track: We are on track to complete the project by the deadline, but we need to address some integration and testing challenges to ensure that all components work seamlessly together.
